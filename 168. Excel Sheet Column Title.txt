Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
 

Example 1:

Input: columnNumber = 1
Output: "A"

Example 2:

Input: columnNumber = 28
Output: "AB"

Example 3:

Input: columnNumber = 701
Output: "ZY"

Approach :   It is an easy marked question on leetcode. We are only given column number. What can be done with it ?

Let us take 2nd test case 28. 

Just hit and trial, let us divide 28 by 26. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 2. Well, that is our answer. 1 for A and 2 for B.
Similarly when it comes to 701, 701 / 26 = 26 and the remainder is 25. 26 for Z and 25 for Y.

But, what if we take a larger number? Like 1000. 
1000 / 26 = 38 and the remainder is 12, we will again divide 38 by 26, 38/26 = 1 and the remainde is 12.
We will store all the remainders and the quotient also 1,12,12 which makes A, L, L.

So, we will keep on dividing columnNumber by 26 until it becomes 0 and store all the remainders to form a string.
